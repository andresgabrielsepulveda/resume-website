                    <p class="p1">Hello, and welcome to my website!</p>
                    <p class="p2">My name is Andres G. Sepulveda. I'm currently working on a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science at Northern Arizona University. My hobbies include playing video games, exercising and eating healthy, spinning rifles, enjoying time with friends and family, and overall enjoying life. When I'm not coding and / or working with computers, I'm leading my peers by participating in the Air Force ROTC program here at Northern Arizona University. My goals are to become a 2nd Lieutenant in the Air Force, and continue my military career in a field well suited for Computer Science.</p>
                    <p class="p2">I built this website all from scratch in 7 hours using raw HTML, CSS, the Fira Sans font from Google Fonts, and images of myself, thanks to some of the training as an Informational Technology Services Web Publisher at Northern Arizona University. This website is hosted thanks to the free web hosting services of GitHub, known as GitHub Pages.</p>
                    <p class="p2">Feel free to browse the site, and learn more about me! This website was created for the sole purpose of allowing the reader to easily view everything important about myself, and was a great learning experience to build. Enjoy!</p>
